    "description": "As Director of CAFA Art Museum, I believe the synergy between our museum's academic framework and the Virtual Curatorial Laboratory is key to nurturing future curators. Our full access to museum resources—including artworks, curatorial expertise, and research dialogues—empowers this virtual platform to explore new curatorial models. Virtual exhibitions are not mere digitizations, but experimental fields to question how space, perception, and audience experience shape contemporary art. This program helps bridge physical and digital, pedagogy and practice, curatorship and creativity. It's not only an educational tool, but also a strategic vision for broader social engagement and cultural innovation.",
