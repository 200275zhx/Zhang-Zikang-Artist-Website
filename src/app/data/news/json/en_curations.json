    "description": "In curating Leandro Erlich: The Confines of the Void at CAFA Art Museum, I sought to showcase how Erlich reexamines the foundations of perception and reality. Inspired by Dream of the Red Chamber and the layered meanings within “illusion,” Erlich created works that invite viewers into spatial narratives where interaction becomes interpretation. From the illusory depths of Swimming Pool to the mirrored dialogues of Changing Room and Lost Garden, his installations transcend cultural boundaries, prompting emotional resonance and philosophical inquiry. I believe this exhibition exemplifies the museum's role in advancing cultural imagination through artistic experience.",
