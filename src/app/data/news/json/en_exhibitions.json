    "description": "On December 29, 2023, I participated in the opening of Radiant Heartlight - Contemporary Art Exhibition at Gallery 3723 in Shanghai, alongside 15 other artists. Curated by Shao Yinong, the exhibition brings together 33 works that explore the emotional spectrum of color and spiritual intuition through diverse mediums. My work joins those of artists like Song Dong, Tan Ping, and Xu Lei, forming a dialogue that invites the audience to perceive art as an extension of inner light and feeling. This exhibition encourages the viewer to reengage with the present moment and discover the vibrant link between instinct, heart, and artistic form.",
